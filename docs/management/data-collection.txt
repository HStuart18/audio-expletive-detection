#Data Collection

*Data Requirements*
- needs to contain the timestamps and transcript of desired word. RNN variant will output the probability that a given frame belongs to each expletive. We need to know the ground truth of whether or not a given frame belongs to one of the expletives. Investigate forced/viterbi alignment. May be able to align words of transcript with audio file to get timestamp information for given word automatically. Maybe there is no need for a speech recognition RNN, just use viterbi alignment to align expletive to audio with certain similarity threshold.
